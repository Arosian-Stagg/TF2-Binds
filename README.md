# Tf2-Binds
hello my good sires, this is my list/ backup for all my coding for my cfg files, it uses a variety of diffrent types of code. Here is a play by play for each class file

All Class: runs autoexec to reformat everything back to basic binds before then editing them with the config. Disables scroll wheel. no likey Scrolly wheely >:(
R gives voice command "NICE SHOT"
T gives voice command "SPY"

Scout: The mouse is used for all weapon changes and basic attacks. 
M1 = equip scattergun and fire. 
M2 = equip bonk/secondary and fire stays on slot 2. 
M3(clicking on the wheel) = pull out and attack. 
Q is used for secondary actions like wrap assasin and shortstop push
