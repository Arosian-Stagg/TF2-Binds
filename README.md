# Tf2-Binds
hello my good sires, this is my list/ backup for all my coding for my cfg files, it uses a variety of diffrent types of code. Here is a play by play for each class file

T gives voice command "SPY"

M1 = equip scattergun and fire. 
M2 = equip bonk/secondary and fire stays on slot 2. 
M3(clicking on the wheel) = pull out and attack. 
Q is used for secondary actions like wrap assasin and shortstop push

Soldier: Simple rocket jump script for lazy people and quick conch with hold down
M2(hold down) = Pulls out slot 2 and uses banner, FUN FACT if you keep holding mouse 2 even when ur done blowing you can hold the charge until you need to activate. upon release it goes back to slot 1 regardless.
M3 = a simple rocket jump script for meduim sized jumps. for longer ones do it ur self ya lazy chuckle nuts :D
Q used for cow mangler on those rare ocassions

Pyro:
