# Tf2-Binds
hello my good sires, this is my list/ backup for all my coding for my cfg files, it uses a variety of diffrent types of code. Here is a play by play for each class file

All Class: runs autoexec to reformat everything back to basic binds before then editing them with the config. Disables scroll wheel. no likey Scrolly wheely >:(
R gives voice command "NICE SHOT"
T gives voice command "SPY"
ALT = toggles the crouch, good for hoovy shenanigans, press alt or ctrl to get out 

Scout: The mouse is used for all weapon changes and basic attacks. 
M1 = equip scattergun and fire. 
M2 = equip bonk/secondary and fire stays on slot 2. 
M3(clicking on the wheel) = pull out and attack. 
Q is used for secondary actions like wrap assasin and shortstop push

Soldier: Simple rocket jump script for lazy people and quick conch with hold down
M2(hold down) = Pulls out slot 2 and uses banner, FUN FACT if you keep holding mouse 2 even when ur done blowing you can hold the charge until you need to activate. upon release it goes back to slot 1 regardless.
M3 = a simple rocket jump script for meduim sized jumps. for longer ones do it ur self ya lazy chuckle nuts :D
Q used for cow mangler on those rare ocassions, secondary action

Pyro: just a simple fast fire for the flare gun
M3(hold down) = pulls out flaregun and fires, upon release goes back to last slot

Demoman: simple and easy sticky jump bind, also includes somewhat of a demoknight movement bind
M3 = triggers jumping and dettonation of stickys, hold down to keep crouching in the air for better movement.
4 used to toggle the demoknight stuff :/

Heavy: easy quick toss of sandvich and quick eat, also a bind to say ur food is on cooldown.
M3(U MUST HOLD DOWN) =(BIT BUGGED WILL LOOK INTO IT) Quick pulls out your food and eats it
Q is a quick toss of your food, hold down q to pull out and toss, gives thanks to your target.
T used to say your food is on cooldown.

Engineer: A quick PDA bypasser and mouse weapon set up, quick loadout presets, and quick eureka teleport
M1 = pulls out shotgun and fires
M2 = pulls out wrench and hits 
M3(push down) = pulls out pistol or wrangler, if level 3 with sentry will fire rockets too.
Q TO PLACE AND PUT DOWN BUILDINGS REMEMBER THIS (IF GUN IS EQUIPED 1 SHOT WILL BE FIRED)
